Hourglass programming language documentation
The hourglass language or infinite x, is a language I'm making in my free time.
It is a combination of web dev languages, programming languages, and database languages. So you can make an entire project in just one language, even the text files can be made in hourglass. Just use //, although github may not recognize it.
Also there will be converters, so java to hourglass or hourglass to java, since java and hourglass are really similar. It can also be converted to html. And maybe I'll make it be able to convert to some database language, highly doubt it though.
